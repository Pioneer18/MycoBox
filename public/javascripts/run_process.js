     * The "Process" is the core function of the application (The Previous Code is to Get a Config to this core function and then start it)
     * 
     * This program utilizes the event loop, which is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operations â€” to run asynchronous subroutines and respond to incoming commands
     * 
     * ----------------------------------------------
     * 1. use the given parameters to set the env_config: temp, co2, humidity, lighting, duration
     * 1a. If initial start boolean is true, block duration clock till environment settings are reached
     * 2. Read the Sensors to check the actual environment status
     * 3. If the current environment does not satisfy the required environment, begin the appropriate asynchronous subroutines
     *   - Increase Temperature slowly: Turn on PID system for .AC
     *   - Decrease Temperature slowly: Turn on PID system for AC
     *   - Decrease Temperature quickly: Turn A/C off 
     *   - Increase Humidity: Turn humidifier on
     *   - Decrease Humidity: Turn humidifier off
     *   - Increase CO2: seal all valves till CO2 levels are reached AND Increase rate of checking CO2 meter during this subroutine
     *   - Decrease C02: open all valves AND turn on intake/exhaust fans, high or low depending on required gradient of change
     *   * Fresh Air is the inverse of CO2
     *   - Fruiting Lighting: switch the light on for the duration
     *   - Incubation Lighting: switch the light off for the duration
     *   - Stream Web Cam: Switch the camera on or off
     *   - Check Scale: ...check the 4 load cells and run function to determine weight
     *   - Maintain a running clock that cannot be paused, only stopped, shortened, or added onto. 
     * 4. Check for Dashboard menu requests (socket.io):
     *   - Open menu
     *   - Close menu (x)
     *   - Stop process
     *   - Reset Default Env_Config (for selected mushroom)
     *   - Update temperature threshold.
     *   - Update humidity threshold
     *   - Update co2 threshold
     * 5. Check the Duration of the System 
     *   - If time remains begin from step 3
     *   - If there is no remaining time, end the session and go to the 'Post Grow Page'
     * 
     *
