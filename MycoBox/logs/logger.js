/**
 * note: use seconds as the unit for the step tests/fopdt/PID controllers
 * note: (DLO), defined as the expected values for set point and major disturbances during normal operation
 * note: When the FOPDT dynamic model is fit to process data, the results describe how PV will respond to a change in CO via the model parameters. In particular:
 * Test Logger
 * Goal:
 * - Create an FOPDT model from the step test data; Kp, Tp, Ó¨p
 * - FOPDT: are to describe the overall dynamic behavior of the process with an approximating model
 * - Why: differential equations relate 1 or more functions and their derivatives; quantities and their rates of chagne
 *      - the direction the PV moves given a change in CO
 *      - how far the PV ultimately travels for a given change in CO
 *      - how fast the PV moves as it heads toward its new steady state
 *      - how much delay occurs between when the CO changes and teh PV first begins to respond
